# IoT-Based-Light-and-Infrared-Sensor-System
This project integrates **Arduino IoT Cloud** with **Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)** and **Infrared (IR)** sensors. It allows real-time monitoring and control of an LED light based on input from the LDR and IR sensors. The system uses **Arduino IoT Cloud** to control and monitor the connected devices remotely.
